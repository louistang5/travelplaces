        <h2>To Be Finished...</h2>
        <p>Normally, October is the perfect time of year to spot the Aurora Borealis in Iceland. And without a doubt, it has
            attracted lots of tourists travelling all the way to this small country, just to capture a hang-on-the-wall picture
            of Aurora. Now this year, holidaymakers heading north could be in for a double treat thanks to its erupting volcano.</p>
        <p>Hold on right there! Did you just say Volcano? Isn't it true that Iceland is covered with ice? Well it is pretty
            cold out there and lots of area ARE covered with ice. So you probably would never expect a volcano sleeping under
            that ground. But truth is there is a huge volcano lying underground, and it is also erupting at this time.</p>
