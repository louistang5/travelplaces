        <h2>What is the Rocky Mountaineer?</h2>
        <p>The Rocky Mountaineer is a privately-owned luxury train company with routes between the west coast and the Canadian
            Rockies (hence the name). The company, begun in 1990, has a variety of itineraries, and two different classes
            of service â€“ Silver Leaf and Gold Leaf. Starting in 2016, all services on the Rocky Mountaineer will enjoy the
            company's signature glass-domed train cars: single-level for Silver Leaf, and double-decker for Gold Leaf. (Take
            it from me: the double-decker Gold Leaf cars give you the best views and experience.)</p>

        <p>Rocky Mountaineer offers packages ranging from 4 to 19 days long, depending on the route and extras you want to throw
            in. Most packages include 2 days at minimum onboard the Rocky Mountaineer train itself. My trip was 7 nights
            long, and I spent 3 days onboard the train.</p>

        <h2>Canada's Wildlife Viewing</h2>
        <p>Along the route, travellers witness breathtaking landscapes, from mighty rivers and snow-capped mountains, to dense
            pine forests and native wildlife. Passengers could get the chance to see mountain goats perched precariously
            on high rock faces, and birds of prey like eagles and ospreys, patrolling the skies. The Canadian Rockies are
            also home to caribou, cougars, coyotes, and wolves, but these animals are notoriously shy. The lucky few will
            catch a glimpse of one of Canada's two native bear species, wandering along the tracks - if a bear is spotted
            the train slows down for passengers to get a better look.</p>

        <p>With 60 perfectly maintained railcars in its fleet and a highly professional lineup of staff members, it's not surprising
            to find out that the Rocky Mountaineer received numerous awards since its founding days. The company's Gold Leaf
            Service was honored with the "World's Leading Travel Experience by Train" award by the "World Travel Awards"
            7 times, while National Geographic Magazine included the Rocky Mountaineer as one of their picks for "World's
            Best Journeys" in 2007.</p>
